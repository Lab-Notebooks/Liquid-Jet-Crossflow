## Reproducibility for Multiphase Fluid Dynamics Benchmarks

This exceedingly simple two dimensional simulation of a rising bubble took 15 hours 
and 350 processors on a supercomputer, representing 4 seconds of physical time.

**Why did it cost so much?**

__ANSWER__: The resolution of this simulation is approximately 1 mm which corresponds to 
500 points covering the bubble (Diameter = 0.5m). Additionally the Reynolds Number (Re), 
which quantifies relationship between inertial and viscous forces, is very low (35 and 
3.5 in liquid and gas respectively), requiring in a time-step of 0.5 microseconds. This 
results in a configuration dominated by diffusion and is designed to test limitations of 
our open-source software, Flash-X, which uses a fully explicit method for solving Multiphase 
Navier-Stokes equations.
